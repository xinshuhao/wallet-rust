//! # BIP39 Mnemonic and Seed Generation
//!
//! This module implements the BIP39 standard for mnemonic generation and seed
//! generation. It is used to generate a mnemonic phrase from a given entropy
//! and to generate a seed from a given mnemonic phrase and a password.
//! The seed can be used to generate a master private key.
//!
//! ## Example
//! ```rust
//! use wallet_rust::bips::bip39::{Mnemonic, MnemonicType};
//! use wallet_rust::bips::wordlists::Language;
//!
//! let mnemonic = Mnemonic::new(MnemonicType::Words12, Language::English);
//! let seed = mnemonic.to_seed("password");
//! ```

mod mnemonic;
mod seed;

pub use mnemonic::*;
pub use seed::*;
